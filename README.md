# Amstrad PC1512 Video Liberator
The Amstrad Video Liberator takes the proprietary video output from the Amstrad PC1512 and converts it to a signal usable with RGB TTL monitors.

The video liberator is based around the low-cost [TI SN74LS04N hex inverter IC](sn74ls04.pdf).

Part of the circuit is inspired by [H2Obsession's "pull both" RGBI to VGA for the Commodore 128](https://sites.google.com/site/h2obsession/CBM/C128/rgbi-to-vga).

Further documentation is available on [the ctrl.alt.rees blog](https://ctrl-alt-rees) for now but relevant parts will be moved over to this repository as the project progresses. Please see the following posts to follow the development history in more detail:
